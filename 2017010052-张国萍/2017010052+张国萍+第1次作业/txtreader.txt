As Chinese education focuses on examination so much, 
teachers always push students very hard for high grades. 
Students have to study hard without any entertainment. 
For example, most students are buried under the mountains of homework. 
Besides, there are too many exams, which are too difficult. 
That's why students always feel stressed and anxious. 
Although the educational department has called for schools to lighten students' burden, 
teachers still assign a lot of homework, some of which are of no significance. 



It is because
 students are too busy
 with their studies, 
who don't have enough 
time 
to
develop
their hobbies. 
They can't get close to nature.
 They know little about the society.
 And they can't communicate well with others,
 either. 
Thus, they can't have all-round development. 
Some students even can't finish their homework until midnight, 
which may cause mental and physical disease. 
This kind of education is unhealthy and even harmful. 
So I suggest students should go out of classroom to
 learn more knowledge from nature and society. Moreover, 
they are supposed to communicate more with people and 
make more friends. In this way, their life will be wonderful and
 meaningful.
